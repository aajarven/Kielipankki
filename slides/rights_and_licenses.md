# LBR: privacy statement

- GDPR requirement when personally identifiable information is handled
- A document crafted specifically for your research
- Universities etc usually provide templates and support

# Bonus: Sensitive Data

At the time of writing, Language Bank does not provide resources that would be so sensitive that special measures such as encryption at rest would be needed. That will likely change in the future, and users might also have sensitive data sets of their own.

Various kinds of data can be sensitive:

- Sensitive personal data (health data, ethnicity...)
- Ecological data (exact locations of [very old specimens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(tree)), details of conservation efforts...)
- Confidential data (trade secrets...)

# Bonus: Sensitive Data Services

- CSC offers services for storing and sharing (SD connect) as well as processing (SD Desktop) sensitive research data
- Services for publishing and reusing sensitive data are being piloted
- For more information, see [docs.csc.fi](https://docs.csc.fi/data/sensitive-data/) and [research.csc.fi](https://research.csc.fi/sensitive-data)
