- During the course, please remember to always mute your microphone when you are not speaking.
- Please use a headset in order to avoid echo (a simple phone headset is just fine).
- You can find all the controls (mic, video, chat, screen sharing) at the bottom of the Zoom window (when you bring your mouse there).
- You can use the chat box for questions and comments, but please make sure you reply to "all panelists and participants" instead of just "all panelists", which is often the default.
- If you have a spoken question/comment, please use the "raise hand" button: we will then give the floor (and microphone rights) to you.
- Note: for questions and answers about the course topics, we will be using this living document

They are completely isolated in terms of audio and video. The host will need to invite you to join the breakout room, after which you can click "Join" in the notification pop-up. Mouse over the number of people in the breakout room to reveal the "Join" button. ![](https://i.imgur.com/wRJ2gqp.png)
